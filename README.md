# Link-Irregular Tournament Search

Python implementation of algorithms for finding link-irregular tournaments.

## What is Link-Irregular?

A tournament is **link-irregular** if no two vertices have isomorphic link graphs (induced subgraphs on their neighborhoods).

## Quick Start
```bash
pip install networkx --break-system-packages
python link_irregular_search.py
```

Searches for link-irregular tournaments on n = 6 to 499 vertices.

## Methods

- Random generation
- Hill-climbing optimization  
- Seeded extension

See `algorithms.pdf` for detailed specifications.
