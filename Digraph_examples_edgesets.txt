In this text file, we present the edge sets of some of the digraphs presented in the paper.

1- The edge set of the digraph, in Figure 4, is
$[(0,1), (0,2), (1,4), (1,2), (2,5), (2,4), (3,4), (3,2), (4,5), (4,0), (5,0), (5,3)]$.

2. The edge set of the digraph, in Figure 5, is as follows:
$[(0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 4), (0, 7), (1, 0), (1, 2), (1, 5), (1, 7), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (3, 8), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 8), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 5), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 5), (7, 6), (7, 8), (8, 0), (8, 1), (8, 2), (8, 4)]$.
